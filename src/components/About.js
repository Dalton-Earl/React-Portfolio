            <p>I was a student at the Univerity of Utah's Full stack web developmet program. 
                The most important skill I learned there was how to learn. We coved a new technology every week for 6 months.
                We started with HTML and ended with react. We coverd JQuery and vanilla javascript. We used CSS frameworks. 
                It was a fantastic entry point into web development. Doing so many new technologie so fast really taught me HOW to learn new things quickly.
                I'm excited for the future and can't wait to make things for a living.
                 on my personal projects I develop on linux.
